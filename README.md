# dyna-frp

Welcome to the `dyna` FRP library for Haskell. The `dyna` is minimal 
and elegant framework that is based on the notion of callbacks. 
It's library to make composable callbacks and observe their 
behavior over time.

Check out the [docs](https://anton-k.github.io/dyna-frp/) for User guide and how to get started.

In this repo there are several libraries:

* `dyna` - core FRP library ([tutorial](https://anton-k.github.io/dyna-frp/dyna-core/tutorial-toc/), [docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dyna), [reference](https://anton-k.github.io/dyna-frp/dyna-core/tutorial/101-reference/))
* `dyna-brick` - binding to `brick` library for terminal user interfaces ([tutorial](https://anton-k.github.io/dyna-frp/dyna-brick/tutorial-toc/), [docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dyna-brick), [reference](https://anton-k.github.io/dyna-frp/dyna-brick/tutorial/101-reference/))
* `dyna-gloss` - binding to `gloss` library for declarative 2D animation and games ([tutorial](https://anton-k.github.io/dyna-frp/dyna-gloss/tutorial-toc/), [docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dyna-gloss), [reference](https://anton-k.github.io/dyna-frp/dyna-gloss/tutorial/101-reference/))
* `dyna-processing` - binding to `processing-for-haskell` library for imperative 
     2D and 3D animation and games  ([tutorial](https://anton-k.github.io/dyna-frp/dyna-processing/tutorial-toc/), [docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dyna-processing), [reference](https://anton-k.github.io/dyna-frp/dyna-processing/tutorial/101-reference/))
