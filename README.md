# dyna-frp

Welcome to the `dyna` FRP library for Haskell. The `dyna` is minimal 
and elegant framework that is based on the notion of callbacks. 
It's library to make composable callbacks and observe their 
behavior over time.

In this repo there are several libraries:

* `dyna` - core FRP library ([tutorial](https://github.com/anton-k/dyna-frp/tree/main/dyna), [docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dyna))
* `dyna-brick` - binding to `brick` library for terminal user interfaces ([tutorial](https://github.com/anton-k/dyna-frp/tree/main/dyna-brick), [docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dyna-brick))
* `dyna-gloss` - binding to `gloss` library for declarative 2D animation and games ([tutorial](https://github.com/anton-k/dyna-frp/tree/main/dyna-gloss), [docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dyna-gloss))
* `dyna-processing` - binding to `processing-for-haskell` library for imperative 
     2D and 3D animation and games  ([tutorial](https://github.com/anton-k/dyna-frp/tree/main/dyna-processing), [docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dyna-processing))
