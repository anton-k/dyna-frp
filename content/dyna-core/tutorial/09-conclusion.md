title: Conclusion
---

We have studied the FRP library `dyna`. 
It features minimal and elegant approach to FRP implementation 
that is easy to grasp and use. I hope
that it will be useful for you to create nice interactive
applications. 

What's next? There are several ready to be used bindings
for `dyna`. 

You can  

* create games and animations with
   `dyna-gloss`.

* create terminal user interfaces (TUI) with
  `dyna-brick`

* more to come in the future

Or maybe you can create binding to some other imperative
library and boost it's expressive power and eloquence 
with FRP approach.
