FRP bindings for library [gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) 
which is great to create 2D animation and graphics. 
It features declarative and functional 
approach to drawing the pictures and we make it even more 
declarative with FRP style.

Gloss hides the pain of drawing simple vector graphics behind a nice 
data type and a few display functions. Gloss uses OpenGL under the hood, 
but you won't need to worry about any of that. Get something cool 
on the screen in under 10 minutes.
