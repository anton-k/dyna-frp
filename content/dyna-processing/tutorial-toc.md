FRP bindings for library [processing-for-haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/processing-for-haskell) 
which is great to create 2D and 3D animation and graphics. 

The library implements the Processing language. 
It's an imperative EDSL for graphics and animation. It's very easy and fun to use. 
There are many books on processing and community is fairly active. 
We can find the quick start guide and lots of examples in the project 
repository on github https://github.com/anton-k/processing-for-haskell (see the directory examples). 
There is a tutorial at the project homepage at github: https://github.com/anton-k/processing-for-haskell
